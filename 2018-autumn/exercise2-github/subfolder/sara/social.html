                    <p>A massive Facebook breach may also have affected users of hundreds of other websites and apps. But three days after the public disclosure of the breach, it's not clear that those companies know what, if anything, might have happened to their users.

                    <p>A spokesperson for the dating app Tinder said Monday that Facebook (FB) has shared only "limited information" and called on Facebook to be "transparent" about which of Tinder's users may have been affected.
                    </p>
                    <p>Identifying that overlap could allow the companies to examine if affected Facebook users' data was also compromised on their platforms.
